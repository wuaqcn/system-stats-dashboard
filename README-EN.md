# system-stats-dashboard
Provides a simple dashboard for viewing system stats, and an API for retrieving said stats programmatically.

There are 3 levels of stats: "current", "recent", and "persisted". Current and recent stats are all kept in memory, and persisted stats are saved to disk. The recent stats are a subset of the persisted stats.

By default:
* Current stats are updated every 3 seconds.
* Every minute, the last minute of current stats are consolidated and added as a single entry to the list of recent and persisted stats.
* 180 entries (3 hours) are kept in the recent list, and 2 megabytes (~2000 entries, ~33 hours) are kept in the persisted list.
* Persisted stats are stored in `./stats_history`.

# Running
* Download the release for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/wuaqcn/system-stats-dashboard/releases) and unzip it to a directory you like.
* Run the `system-stats-dashboard` executable.
* Go to `localhost:8001/dashboard` and take a gander at some stats.

# Configuration
Configuration options are located in `Rocket.toml`.
|Name|Default value|Description|
|----|-------------|-----------|
|address|`"0.0.0.0"`|The address to run the server on|
|port|`8001`|The port to run the server on|
|recent_history_size|`180`|The number of entries to keep in recent history|
|consolidation_limit|`20`|The number of entries to collect before consolidating them and writing an entry to recent and persisted stats|
|update_frequency_seconds|`3`|The number of seconds to wait between each stats collection|
|persist_history|`true`|Whether to persist stats to disk or not. If set to `false`, all the config options below are ignored.|
|history_files_directory|`"./stats_history"`|The directory to persist stats to|
|history_files_max_size_bytes|`2_000_000`|The maximum size, in bytes, to allow `history_files_directory` to grow to|

# Endpoints

## Dashboard

### `/dashboard`
Displays current stats, as well as graphs of some recent stats. Defaults to dark mode; add `?dark=false` for light mode.

### `/dashboard/history`
Same as `/dashboard`, except for persisted stats.

## API
